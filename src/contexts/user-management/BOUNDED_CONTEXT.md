# User Management Bounded Context

## Overview
The User Management bounded context is responsible for managing user accounts, profiles, authentication, and user-related operations within the system. This is a core business domain that handles the complete user lifecycle from registration to account management.

## Core Responsibilities
- **User Registration**: Create new user accounts with proper validation
- **User Profile Management**: Maintain user personal information and preferences
- **User Status Management**: Handle user account states (active, inactive, suspended, etc.)
- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Manage user credentials and access permissions
- **User Directory Operations**: List and search users within the system
- **User Account Operations**: Handle account updates, deactivation, and other lifecycle events

## Domain Model

### Entities
- **User**: The main aggregate root representing a user in the system
  - Contains user identity, profile information, and account status
  - Enforces business rules around user creation and updates
  - Manages user lifecycle and status transitions

### Value Objects
- **Email**: Encapsulates email validation and formatting rules
- **Username**: Ensures username uniqueness and format validation
- **UserProfile**: Contains user personal information and preferences
- **UserRole**: Defines user permissions and access levels

### Use Cases
- **CreateUserUseCase**: Creates new user accounts with validation and conflict detection
- **GetUserByIdUseCase**: Retrieves individual users by their unique identifier
- **ListUsersUseCase**: Returns paginated lists of users from the directory
- **UpdateUserProfileUseCase**: Handles user profile updates with proper validation
- **UpdateUserStatusUseCase**: Manages user account status changes

## Architecture Patterns
This bounded context follows Clean Architecture principles with:
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and user entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data persistence and external integrations
- **Presentation Layer**: API controllers and DTOs

## Key Features
- Comprehensive user validation using domain-driven design
- Email and username uniqueness enforcement
- User status lifecycle management
- Role-based access control integration
- Rich domain model with encapsulated business rules
- Profile management with privacy controls

## Integration Points
- Provides authentication services for other bounded contexts
- Publishes domain events for user lifecycle changes
- Exposes user directory APIs for system-wide user lookups
- Integrates with external identity providers and authentication systems

## Security Considerations
- Secure password handling and storage
- User session management
- Role-based authorization
- Privacy compliance and data protection
- Audit logging for user operations
