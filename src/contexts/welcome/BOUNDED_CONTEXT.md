# Welcome Bounded Context

## Overview
The Welcome bounded context serves as a generic utility module that provides basic greeting and introductory functionality for the application. This is a supporting domain that handles simple welcome operations and serves as an example implementation of the clean architecture pattern.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Welcome Services**: Provide personalized greeting functionality
- **Health Check Operations**: Basic system health and connectivity validation
- **API Demonstration**: Serve as a reference implementation for API patterns
- **System Introduction**: Provide introductory endpoints for new users or systems

## Domain Model

### Controllers
- **WelcomeController**: Main controller handling welcome-related HTTP endpoints
  - Provides parameterized greeting functionality
  - Demonstrates proper API response formatting
  - Implements base controller patterns

### Key Endpoints
- **GET /hello/:name**: Returns personalized greeting messages
  - Accepts name parameter for personalization
  - Returns standardized success response format
  - Demonstrates parameter handling and response formatting

## Architecture Patterns
This bounded context follows Clean Architecture principles with:
- **Presentation Layer**: API controllers and routing
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Utilizes common response formatting and error handling
- **Base Controller Pattern**: Extends shared controller abstractions

## Key Features
- Simple parameterized greeting functionality
- Standardized API response format demonstration
- Clean architecture pattern implementation
- RESTful endpoint design
- Proper HTTP status code handling

## Integration Points
- Serves as API gateway entry point for system health checks
- Provides example patterns for other bounded contexts
- Demonstrates shared infrastructure usage
- Can be extended for system-wide announcements or messaging

## Use Cases
- **System Health Verification**: Quick endpoint to verify system availability
- **API Pattern Reference**: Example implementation for other developers
- **User Onboarding**: Initial greeting for new users or integrations
- **Development Testing**: Simple endpoint for API testing and validation

## Technical Implementation
- Lightweight controller-based implementation
- Minimal business logic complexity
- Focus on infrastructure pattern demonstration
- Generic classification allows for flexible usage across different application domains
