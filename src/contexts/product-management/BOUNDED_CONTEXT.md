# Product Management Bounded Context

## Overview
The Product Management bounded context is responsible for managing the lifecycle and operations of products within the system. This is a core business domain that handles product creation, pricing, inventory tracking, and status management.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Product Creation**: Create new products with proper validation and business rules
- **Product Information Management**: Maintain product details, descriptions, and metadata
- **Pricing Management**: Handle product pricing operations including price updates
- **Product Status Management**: Manage product lifecycle states (draft, active, archived)
- **Product Catalog Operations**: List and search products in the catalog
- **SKU Management**: Ensure unique product SKUs and handle SKU-based operations

## Domain Model

### Entities
- **Product**: The main aggregate root representing a product in the system
  - Contains product identity, name, SKU, description, price, and status
  - Enforces business rules around product creation and updates
  - Manages product lifecycle states

### Value Objects
- **ProductName**: Encapsulates product naming rules and validation
- **ProductSku**: Ensures SKU uniqueness and format validation
- **Money**: Handles monetary amounts with currency support

### Use Cases
- **CreateProductUseCase**: Creates new products with validation and conflict detection
- **GetProductByIdUseCase**: Retrieves individual products by their unique identifier
- **ListProductsUseCase**: Returns paginated lists of products from the catalog
- **UpdateProductPriceUseCase**: Handles product price updates with proper validation

## Architecture Patterns
This bounded context follows Clean Architecture principles with:
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data persistence and external integrations
- **Presentation Layer**: API controllers and DTOs

## Key Features
- Comprehensive product validation using domain-driven design
- Money handling with multi-currency support
- SKU uniqueness enforcement
- Product status lifecycle management
- Rich domain model with encapsulated business rules

## Integration Points
- Exposes product information for other bounded contexts
- Publishes domain events for product lifecycle changes
- Provides APIs for product catalog operations
